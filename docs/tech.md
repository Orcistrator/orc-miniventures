# Technology Stack for Miniventures

This document outlines the technology choices and architecture for implementing the Miniventures application as described in the PRD.

## 1. Overview

Miniventures will be implemented as a modern web application with a focus on simplicity, performance, and cost efficiency. The application will primarily use client-side rendering with serverless functions for handling AI integration and other backend operations.

## 2. Frontend

### 2.1 Core Framework
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, offering a component-based architecture that aligns well with the modular nature of the application.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, simplifying development and improving performance.

### 2.2 UI and Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with minimal custom CSS.
- **Headless UI**: Accessible UI components that work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS.
- **React Hook Form**: For efficient form handling with validation.

### 2.3 State Management
- **React Context API**: For simple state management across components.
- **Zustand**: A lightweight state management solution for more complex state requirements if needed.

## 3. Backend

### 3.1 Architecture
- **Serverless Functions**: Using Next.js API routes or Vercel/Netlify Functions to handle backend operations without maintaining a dedicated server.
- **Edge Functions**: For low-latency operations where applicable.

### 3.2 Data Storage
- **Client-side Storage**: Using browser localStorage for session-based adventure data.
- **No Database Required**: As specified in the PRD, persistent storage is not required since adventures are completed in a single session.

## 4. AI Integration

### 4.1 AI Provider Options
- **Primary Option: OpenAI API (GPT-3.5 Turbo)**: 
  - Free tier available with rate limits
  - Well-documented API with strong capabilities for narrative generation
  - Costs can be managed by optimizing prompt design and token usage

- **Alternative Options**:
  - **Hugging Face Inference API**: Free tier available for open-source models
  - **Ollama**: Self-hosted open-source LLMs if server resources are available
  - **Anthropic Claude (via AWS Bedrock)**: If more advanced capabilities are needed

### 4.2 AI Implementation
- **Serverless Function Wrapper**: To securely manage API keys and handle requests
- **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully designed prompts to generate appropriate RPG content
- **Streaming Responses**: To improve perceived performance for longer generations

## 5. Procedural Generation

### 5.1 RPG Data Sources
- **D&D 5E API**: Free API for accessing D&D 5E data (https://www.dnd5eapi.co/)
- **Custom Algorithms**: For generating balanced encounters, NPCs, and other game elements
- **Randomization Libraries**: Such as Chance.js for consistent random generation

### 5.2 Implementation Approach
- **Client-side Generation**: Where possible to reduce server load
- **Serverless Functions**: For more complex generation that requires external data

## 6. Deployment and Hosting

### 6.1 Hosting Platform
- **Vercel**: Primary recommendation for hosting the Next.js application
  - Free tier available
  - Excellent integration with Next.js
  - Global CDN for fast content delivery
  - Serverless functions included

### 6.2 CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**: For automated testing and deployment
- **Vercel GitHub Integration**: For preview deployments on pull requests

## 7. Development Environment

### 7.1 Tools and Setup
- **Package Manager**: npm (or pnpm for better performance and disk space usage)
- **Development Environment**: VS Code with recommended extensions:
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
  - GitHub Copilot (if available)

### 7.2 Project Structure
- Next.js app directory structure:
  ```
  miniventures/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── api/         # API routes for serverless functions
  │   ├── components/  # Reusable UI components
  │   ├── lib/         # Utility functions and hooks
  │   ├── models/      # Type definitions and data models
  │   ├── services/    # Service layer for external APIs
  │   └── [routes]/    # Page components

  ├── styles/          # Global styles
  ├── docs/            # Documentation
  └── tests/           # Test files
  ```

## 8. Authentication

### 8.1 Recommendation
- **No Authentication Required**: Based on the PRD, the application doesn't require user accounts or persistent data storage.
- **Future Consideration**: If needed later, implement GitHub OAuth for simple authentication.

## 9. Performance Optimization

### 9.1 Strategies
- **Code Splitting**: To reduce initial load time
- **Static Generation**: For non-dynamic pages
- **Image Optimization**: Using Next.js Image component
- **Caching**: For AI responses and external API calls
- **Lazy Loading**: For components not needed on initial render

## 10. Accessibility

### 10.1 Implementation
- **ARIA Attributes**: Properly implemented throughout the application
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensuring all features are accessible via keyboard
- **Color Contrast**: Meeting WCAG AA standards
- **Screen Reader Support**: Testing with popular screen readers

## 11. Browser Compatibility

- **Target Browsers**: Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works even if some advanced features aren't supported

## 12. Security Considerations

### 12.1 Measures
- **API Key Protection**: All API keys stored as environment variables and accessed only via serverless functions
- **Content Security Policy**: To prevent XSS attacks
- **Input Validation**: For all user inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse of AI generation features

## 13. Cost Management

### 13.1 Strategies
- **Optimized AI Prompts**: To minimize token usage
- **Caching Common Responses**: To reduce API calls
- **Free Tier Services**: Utilizing free tiers of all services where possible
- **Usage Monitoring**: Setting up alerts for approaching limits

## 14. Future Considerations

- **Offline Support**: If requirements change to support offline functionality
- **Integration with Orcistrator**: As mentioned in the PRD for future expansion
- **Additional RPG Systems**: Support for systems beyond the generic fantasy setting
